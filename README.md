# VanillaJSArrayCardio

This is a part of a 30-Day challenge I am doing to develop on Vanilla JS project everyday, for all 30 days. These projects are intended to be simple in that they use plain Javascript, CSS, and HTML ONLY. Each project goes over basic concepts every JavaScript Developer should know, and tricks they may not.
